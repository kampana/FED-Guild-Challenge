# P-Angular-Upgrade

We'd like to build a generic angular upgrade component, so we'll be able use a single "p-angular-upgrade" component for all our upgrade/downgrade components.

## How to run:

1. npm install
2. npm start

## What to check

1. \src\oldProject\core\main.js
2. \src\app\angular-entry-point.component.ts
3. \src\app\p-angular-upgrade.component.ts
